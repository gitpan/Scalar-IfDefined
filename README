Scalar-IfDefined

This is useful for calling a block of code that can only (or it is only useful to)
be called on a scalar value.

Defines a function 'ifdef' which takes a block or coderef as the first argument,
and a scalar value as its second.

If the scalar value passed in is undef, then that undef is returned.

If the scalar value passed in is defined, then a block (or CODEREF) is run with the scalar
as its argument, and that block's return value is returned to ifdef's caller.
